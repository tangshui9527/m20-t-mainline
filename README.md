# m20-t-mainline

Mainline Linux for the **Hisense M20-T** (Uniscope ODM, **MSM8909 / Snapdragon 210**,
stock Android 4.4.4, soc_id 245/0xf5). Target system: a minimal **headless Linux
server** (USB network + SSH, WiFi later) — no display / touch / audio work —
the phone acts as a boot-and-serve box.

## Status (2026-10-31)

**Boot chain working end to end up to the kernel; the kernel itself hangs early.**

* stock bootloader (untouched) → **[lk2nd](https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd)
  23.1** `lk2nd-msm8909` flashed into the `boot` partition at offset 0 — works:
  full fastboot, boot menu, display panel driven by lk2nd
* mainline kernel images are RAM-booted via `fastboot boot` through lk2nd for
  testing (no flashing per iteration; the device auto-returns to lk2nd fastboot
  after a failed boot)
* kernel base switched to the proven msm8909 line: [weikaizhi4/linux](https://github.com/weikaizhi4/linux)
  @ `410d5647` (7.0-based; nokia-leo / lenovo-p5100 / zte-sapphire / zu02-dw01
  msm8909 boards boot this tree) + the [ufi210-debian](https://github.com/3899/ufi210-debian)
  reference config (validated on the same SoC, soc_id 245)
* **current blocker:** the kernel hangs in early boot (not a panic — verified by
  a `panic=-1` experiment; lk2nd's watchdog resets it ~10 s in). A DEBUG_LL
  "RAM console" patch (earlyprintk → fixed RAM buffer at phys 0x8f001000) is in
  the build to capture the early boot log; read-back happens from stock Android
  via `/dev/mem`.

## Build

GitHub Actions on push — see `.github/workflows/build.yml`. Artifacts:
`m20t-boot.img` (lk2nd layout, raw zu02 DTB), `m20t-qcom-msm8909-nokia-leo.img`
(board-bisection variant), `zImage`, DTB, modules, initramfs.

## Boot chain notes (M20-T specific, reverse-engineered)

* stock `aboot` requires the DT segment of a boot image to be a **dtbTool
  "QCDT" table** (magic `0x54444351`); a bare FDT blob is rejected
  ("Bad magic in device tree table") and the device falls back to its own
  fastboot (USB `18d1:d00d`) without ever launching the kernel —
  `tools/wrap-dt-qcdt.py` wraps a DTB into a QCDT v3 single-entry table
  (`soc=0xf5, board=0x1000b, subtype=0`, the stock-selected dtb17 entry)
* the stock aboot injects `bootargs`/initrd and the **DDR size into a node
  named exactly `/memory`** (exact-path lookup; `memory@80000000` does not
  match) — keep that node name in any board DTS
* lk2nd occupies the first 512 KiB of `boot`; the real boot image is flashed
  at `boot + 512 KiB` (`fastboot flash boot` handles the offset)
* lk2nd needs the QCDT wrapper too (`fastboot boot` with a bare-DTB image is
  rejected with "dtb not found")
* the stock bootloader accepts unsigned boot images (no secboot fuse blown);
  no fastboot flash/boot commands exist in stock (getvar/download only)

## Installation / recovery

lk2nd route: flash `lk2nd-msm8909.img` (from
[msm8916-mainline/lk2nd releases](https://github.com/msm8916-mainline/lk2nd/releases))
to `boot`, then `fastboot flash boot m20t-boot.img` under lk2nd.
Stock route (root+dd) and full partition forensics: `docs/install.md`.
Recovery from any state: EDL (9008) firehose write of the stock `boot`
partition backup.
